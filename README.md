 * The only repo for roms

* NOTICE:
* The use of ROMs for fair use is a legal gray area. While some argue that the use of ROMs for personal use is a violation of copyright law, others maintain that the use of ROMs for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research is a fair use.

The fair use doctrine allows for limited use of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder. To qualify as a fair use, the use must be non-commercial, and it must be for a purpose that is not primarily to profit from the copyrighted material. Additionally, the use must not infringe on the copyright holderâ€™s exclusive rights to the material.

The use of ROMs for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research is generally considered to be a fair use. For example, a professor may use a ROM in a classroom for the purpose of teaching. Similarly, a student may use a ROM for the purpose of research.

However, the use of ROMs for commercial purposes is not generally considered to be a fair use. For example, a business that uses ROMs to create a competing product is not likely to be protected by the fair use doctrine.
